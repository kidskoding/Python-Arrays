#you can do this code
food = ["Ice Cream", "Cake", "Cookie"]
 
food.pop(1)
 
print(food)

#or this code
food = ["Ice Cream", "Cake", "Cookie"]
 
food.remove("Cake")
 
print(food)


#the pop method requires an index and the remove method requires the value. Either way, they both remove items from the arrays
